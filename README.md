Challenge assignment for VBA

For the code to find the last row- it was recommended by professor and slack admin to use this rather than my more complicated script.

From:
https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-last-row/

	Used within Script as:
	"last_row = ws.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).row"

	and
	"list_last_row = ws.Cells(Rows.Count, 9).End(xlUp).row"


Thank you in advance for any feedback!
